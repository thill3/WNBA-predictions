Attempt to scrape WNBA game data and predict future games


This is some Python code I wrote to attempt to scrape data of WNBA games and predict future outcomes.
It was not very successful. My guess is that it needs more input. Feature engineering and past game history would help. Maybe some exponential smoothing of input features.
